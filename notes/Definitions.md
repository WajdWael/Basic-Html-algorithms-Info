### Definitions


# Algorithm:
An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.

# Heuristic Approach:
A Heuristic Approach is an approach to problem-solving that may not be fully specified or may not guarantee correct, especially in problem domains where there is no well-defined correct or optimal result.

# Randomized Algorithm:
is an algorithm that employs a degree of randomness as part of its logic or procedure. For example, in Randomized Quick Sort, we use random number to pick the next pivot (or we randomly shuffle the array). Typically, this randomness is used to reduce time complexity or space complexity in other standard algorithms.

> In computing, iteration is the technique marking out of a block of statements within a computer program for a defined number of repetitions.

# Turing-complete:
In computability theory, a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a computer's instruction set, a programming language, or a cellular automaton) is said to be Turing-complete or computationally universal if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine. 

# Pseudocode:
In computer science, pseudocode is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or another system, it uses structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading.

# Programming language:
is any set of rules that converts strings, or graphical program elements in the case of visual programming language, to various kinds of machine code output.


# Dynamic programming:
is both a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method. The method was developed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields, from aerospace engineering to economics.

# Turing completeness:
In computability theory aka **(recursion theory)**, a system of data-manipulation rules is said to be Turing-complete or computationally universal if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine. This means that this system is able to recognize or decide other data-manipulation rule sets. Wikipedia.

# What is the difference between an **optimal algorithm** and a **non-optimal** one?

An optimal algorithm, even running in old hardware, would produce faster results than a non-optimal (higher time complexity) algorithm for the same purpose, running in more efficient hardware.
